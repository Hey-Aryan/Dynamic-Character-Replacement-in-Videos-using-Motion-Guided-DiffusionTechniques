# Dynamic-Character-Replacement-in-Videos-using-Motion-Guided-DiffusionTechniques

Abstractâ€”Diffusion-based techniques have the ability to produce lifelike images and movies. However, they face challenges when it comes to modifying objects in a video while maintaining their visual consistency throughout the duration. This hinders the use of diffusion models to practical circumstances of natural video editing. This research addresses the problem by incorporating temporal dependency into current text-driven diffusion models. This enhancement enables the models to produce coherent visual representations for the altered objects. Our research focuses on creating a new method for diffusion video editing. This method involves using layered representations to transfer the appearance information from one frame to the next.

For instance, we have the ability to modify the location and arrangement of one or more objects within a video, while maintaining its original attributes and exchanging them with others. Our technology enables the substitution of a full-body character in a movie with an input image, accurately replicating its motions and facial expressions. This is achieved using a single high-resolution user-provided natural video. In contrast to prior research, our suggested approach necessitates solely one input image and a target video (the intended modification). The algorithm functions on authentic photographs without the need for other inputs, such as image masks or extra perspectives of the object.Subsequently, we construct a video editing framework that is driven by text, utilizing this method to create video editing that is consistent and aware. Our technique has been proven to have a high level of editing capabilities through extensive testing. Our methodology demonstrates superior qualitative and quantitative outcomes when compared to state-of-the-art video editing methods.
